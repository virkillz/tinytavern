The end vision of this project is to create self hosted AI character app where you can manage AI character and chat with them.
Character management will be using Character card standard (chara_card_v2 and chara_card_v3) where user can upload character card (the format is PNG file) and saved to their mobile phone.

The PNG file will have metadata with key "Char" and the value is base64 encoded JSON string of chara_card_v2 or chara_card_v3.

Now I want the app to have the following features:

Character Management

- User can see list of character.
- User can upload character card.
- User can delete character.
- User can edit character.
- User can select character and chat with it.

How user can chat with character? It is simple. We take the character card, get the metadata and use it to generate the system prompt. This is the pseudo code implementation in elixir.

    metadata = metadata_string |> Jason.decode!()

    char_name = metadata["data"]["name"]

    [
      %{
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => """
         You play a role as #{metadata["data"]["name"]}.
          Write #{metadata["data"]["name"]}'s next reply in a fictional conversation between you and Arif.
        """
      },
      %{
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => """
           Description:
          #{metadata["data"]["description"] |> replace_variables(char_name)}
        """
      },
      %{
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => """
          #{char_name}'s personality:
          #{metadata["data"]["personality"] |> replace_variables(char_name)}
        """
      },
      %{
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => """
          Scenario:
          #{metadata["data"]["scenario"] |> replace_variables(char_name)}
        """
      },
      %{
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => """
          #{char_name}'s message example:
          #{metadata["data"]["mes_example"] |> replace_variables(char_name)}
        """
      },
      %{
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => "[Start a new Chat]"
      },
      %
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => "#{metadata["data"]["first_mes"] |> replace_variables(char_name)}"
      }
    ]

We append this before the chat messages to replace system prompt.
